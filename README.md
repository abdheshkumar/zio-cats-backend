## zio-cats-backend

A backend service integrating ZIO with cats, http4s, doobie and tapir 

The idea of this project is to showcase how to leverage the ZIO library together with really well designed libraries in the scala ecosytem that, although not designed for ZIO itself, they abstracted over the effect implementation.
